<p>This extension provides a simple way to modify any part of an HTTP message,
allowing manipulation with surgical precision even when using macros.
Typically, macros only support HTTP parameters (name=value), but with 
this extension anything can be targeted as if it were a parameter.</p>
<p>Features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic modification of requests and/or responses, based on scope and pattern matching.</li>
  <li>Find and replace, with support for regular expressions.</li>
  <li>Scoping to specific Burp Suite tools.</li>
  <li>Targeting specific matches (only first, all matches, or hand-picked).</li>
  <li>Chaining and ordering of modifications, and the ability to base next-in-line modifications off previous responses.</li>
  <li>
      Save/load Config:
  </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Quicksave/quickload (persists between Burp/Extender sessions).</li>
      <li>Import/export from and to JSON files.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>After running a macro, extract a replacement value from its final response.</li>
  <li>Modifying each request/response <em>within</em> a macro.</li>
</ul>
